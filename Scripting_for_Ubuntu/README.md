# RS485 example with logs, on Ubuntu

This example is a modification of original one unedr windows, here, we can see interaction from batch calling docklight script execution under wine installation, creating a log file based on test parameters, and finally activatting windows voice engine (pending to do microsoft tts adaption in ubunutu, under review [this project](https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts)), in order to notify the operator of any news about the process.

Also in this example, the main device interacts with the second device through the RS485 communication port, which is used through an RS232-RS485 converter, remember that docklight installation is made using wine on ubuntu, so, in order to control activation and deactivation signal, must do a proper setup of ports (com port in windows). The control of ports, power on, and interruption of lines A and B of RS485 is done through a relay card controlled by the script, a  command line project for Arduino can be found [here](https://github.com/farrojo/ArduinoCommandLineInterface).


```TestControl.sh``` drives the main execution, calling the docklight under wine installation, it is pretty important to keep in mind, that as it, docklight runs and call a .pts file that is essentially a VB script adapted to this software, its facillity makes ideal to be kept in the same project. Other fiels keep the same, only paths must be modified in order to run.
